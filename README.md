## Overview üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è
The genesis of this project stems from my unwavering curiosity to delve deeper into the realm of development. With over 2 years of frontend experience under my belt, I harbored a yearning to explore the backend landscape. The allure of crafting the intricate gears that drive applications compelled me to embark on this backend development journey.

As a frontend developer, I developed a penchant for user-centric design and seamless interactions. Now, my focus broadens as I set my sights on becoming a full-stack developer. This streaming platform serves as the embodiment of my aspirations, offering users not only the joy of content consumption but also a community hub for discourse and engagement.

## Why This Project ‚ùì
With a thirst for knowledge, I embarked on this backend endeavor. After honing my frontend skills for over 2 years, the desire to understand the holistic development process grew intense. My curiosity was piqued by the intricate mechanisms that fuel applications, particularly those under the hood. I saw the backend as a fascinating realm, a complex symphony of data management, security, and optimization.
